device-sizer
============

`device-sizer` is a Library that extracts mobile device's portrait/landscape character size comparing user-agent to various regex patterns.

It is highly influenced by [ua-parser](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser) project, derived regex patterns from [YAML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobie/ua-parser/master/regexes.yaml).
